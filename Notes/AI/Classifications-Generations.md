## 📊 AI Classifications & Generations

Artificial Intelligence is classified based on its **capability** (what it can do) and its **evolutionary stage** (how it "thinks"). Understanding these distinctions is crucial for identifying where we are today versus where we are headed.

---

### Core Classifications:

- **Narrow AI:** Specialized in one task (e.g., facial recognition, chatbots).
  - It is also called as Weak AI.
- **General AI:** A theoretical state where a machine can perform any intellectual task a human can.
  - It is also called as Strong AI.
- **Agentic AI:** The current 2025 trend—autonomous agents capable of using tools and making decisions without constant human supervision.

### 1. The "S" Spectrum: ANI, AGI, and ASI

- This is the most common way to categorize AI based on its cognitive reach.

| Type | Name | Definition | Status (2025) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ANI** | **Artificial Narrow Intelligence** | "Weak AI" designed for specific tasks (e.g., chess, face ID, translation). | **Fully Deployed** |
| **AGI** | **Artificial General Intelligence** | "Strong AI" that matches human cognitive abilities across all domains. | **In Development** |
| **ASI** | **Artificial Super Intelligence** | AI that surpasses human intelligence in every field, including creativity and social skills. | **Theoretical** |

### 2. The Agentic Era (2025 Trend)

We have moved past simple "Chatbots" into the era of **Agentic AI**. 
* **Narrow AI** responds to a prompt.
* **Agentic AI** takes a goal (e.g., "Research this topic and write a report") and independently plans steps, uses tools (browsers, code interpreters), and executes the workflow without human hand-holding.

### 3. Biological Frontier: Organoid Intelligence (OI)
Often referred to as **"Organ-intelligence"** or biological wetware:
* **Definition:** A field that combines **3D cultures of human brain cells (organoids)** with AI interfaces.
* **Goal:** To create "biocomputers" that are millions of times more energy-efficient than silicon-based chips. 
* **Key Advantage:** Biological systems excel at "few-shot learning" (learning from very little data) where silicon AI requires massive datasets.

### 4. OpenAI’s 5 Levels of AGI Progress

- To track the journey toward General Intelligence, the industry currently uses this 5-level roadmap:

1.  **Level 1: Chatbots** – AI with conversational language (e.g., basic ChatGPT).
2.  **Level 2: Reasoners** – AI capable of human-level problem solving (e.g., GPT-o1, Gemini 2.0).
3.  **Level 3: Agents** – Systems that can act on a user's behalf for days/weeks.
4.  **Level 4: Innovators** – AI that can assist in discovering new scientific laws.
5.  **Level 5: Organizations** – AI that can run an entire company's operations autonomously.

### 🧠 Key Concept: Theory of Mind vs. Self-Awareness
* **Theory of Mind:** The AI's ability to understand that humans have their own emotions and thoughts. (Current research focus).
* **Self-Awareness:** The theoretical "holy grail" where AI has its own consciousness and desires. (No evidence of this yet in 2025).
